# Whiteboard Challenge 8

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This challenge is to create a function that accepts the head of two singly linked lists as its arguments, identifies if there are any values present in both lists, and returns those values as a new singly linked list. 
```
SLL1 {head: {val:1, next:{val:3, next: {val:5, next:null}}}};
SLL2 {head: {val:1, next:{val:2, next: {val:5, next:null}}}};

duplicateValues(SLL1.head, SLL2.head);
>>> newSLL {head: {val:1 , next: {val: 5, next:null}}};
```

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
