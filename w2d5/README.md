# Whiteboarding Challenge 10

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
We were given two different challenges to complete today. The first was to write a function, `checkBraces()` to examine whether the pairs and the orders of `{` and `}` in a given string matched and were syntactically correct. Meaning, each opening curly bracket had a matching curly bracket and were properly paired with one another would generate syntacticlly valid code. This was to be implemented using a Stack data structure.

Our second challenge was write a function that accepted two arguments, `n` and a sorted array, and to utilize a binary search tree on the given array using the given `n` value. If the given `n` was found, the function should return the value and its location in the array as an object of key-value pairs such as `{value: n, index: 1}`.

## Getting Started
First, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions.
