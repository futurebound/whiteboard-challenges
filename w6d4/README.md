# Whiteboard Challenge 29

**Author**: Mitchell

**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This challenge is to create a function that sorts an array of strings so that all the anagrams are next to one another. This means input and output should look like:
```
sortAnagrams(['acre', 'act', 'race', 'cat', 'tac', 'care'])
=> ['acre', 'care', 'race', 'act', 'cat', 'tac', ]
```

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
