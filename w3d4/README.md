# Whiteboarding Challenge 14

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This challenge was to write a fuction, `dedupe(head)`, that accepts the head of a linked list as it's argument, and returns a new linked list. To do this, we need to use a stack to identify any consecutive duplications, and remove them from the list (i.e. it's ok for the given linked list to have duplications overall, but if they come one right after another we need to get them outta there).

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
