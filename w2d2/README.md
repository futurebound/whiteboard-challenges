# Whiteboard Challenge 7

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This challenge was to write a function accepting a singly linked list as the only arugments. If the passed list is circular (i.e. has no end, no next of null) the function should return true, else it should return false.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
