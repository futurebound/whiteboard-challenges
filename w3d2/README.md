# Whiteboarding Challenge 12

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This challenge was to implement a Queue using only two Stacks. This means we should be able to use `enqueue(value)` and `dequeue()` Queue methods each with code specifically utilizing two separate Stacks with `push(val)` and `pop()` methods being called within the enqueue/dequeue methods to create the desired behavior.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
