# Whiteboard Challenge 32

**Author**: Mitchell

**Version**: 1.0.0

# Overview
This challenge is to write two functions that return the `nth` entry in the fibonacci series, both iteratively and recursively. The fibonacci series is an ordering of numbers where each number is the sum of the preceeding two, such that:
```
fibonacci series: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ... ]

<iteratively || recursively>(4);
=> 3
```

### Note
Although it is possible, it is inadvisable to use the recursive approach to this solution. This is due to 

# Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. If wanting to view tests, enter `npm install -D` into the command line. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
