# Whiteboard Challenge 18

**Author**: Mitchell
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview
This challenge is to create a function that accepts a single argument, an instance of a `K-ary` tree. It will determine what node has the highest amount of children in the given tree, and return that node as its output. If there are two or more nodes with the same amount of children, the function will reference the 1st node it encountered with the highest amount of children.

## Getting Started
To get this application up and running, fork and/or clone this repository using the `git clone <git repository link>` command in your terminal. Next, run the `npm install` command, which will install all the necessary dependencies in the accompanying package.json file. After those packages have installed, you can run `npm test` to explore the included tests and functionality of their respective solutions. You can open up the code in your favorite editor to explore/modify the code, see how the tests are structured, and create tests of your own if desired.
